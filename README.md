With a simple sketcbook project I will demonstrate my Javascript logic skills and DOM manipulation.

The project is about the sketcbook which is being filled with divs (squares) that are transparent once the user inputs the grid size through the prompt (which is triggered with the button);

User can choose color for the sketch and also reset the whole sketchbook by clicking on the reset button which will trigger the prompt for grid size once again.
